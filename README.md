# Decision Tree

In this project, I implemented a decision tree, a fundamental machine learning model that can make predictions based on its training data. This program can read in datasets from any CSV, parse the CSV to generate a decision tree, and then make predictions about new data. The model was evaluated by a percentage reflecting its accuracy on the testing data.
